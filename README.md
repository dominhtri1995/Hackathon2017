## Inspiration
Inspired by the recent wave of suicides at Columbia, we want to make an app that can track user's emotion and provide recommendations as appropriate.
## What it does
First, we prompt the user to provide an image of their face, either through camera or via existing files. Then, the user is presented a quote according to his/her current mood. If the user has a record of negative emotions (sad, angry, disgust, contempt, or fear), then the app will show a suggestion to seek Psychological Services at Columbia.
## How we built it
We used Microsoft's Emotion API to do analysis on the image, categorizing it into 8 moods: neutral, happy, sad, angry, surprise, disgust, contempt, or fear. Depending on the analysis, quotes and suggestions are shown accordingly.
## Challenges we ran into
Building an Android app for the first time, using Microsoft's API, designing interface
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Orange button ftw!
## What we learned
Orange fits well with blue
## What's next for Hackathon2017
Better user interface, more diagnostic, more suggestion types (other than quotes)
